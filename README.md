## How you doin'? 

Iâ€™ve recently completed a comprehensive âœ¨web developmentâœ¨ bootcamp, where I refined my skills in building engaging and responsive websites and apps.
With a strong focus on React, Next.js, MongoDB, and API integration, I combine my background in UX design with my development expertise to craft intuitive user interfaces and seamless user experiences. ðŸ§ 
Excited to keep growing as a developer and bringing innovative ideas to life! ðŸš€
