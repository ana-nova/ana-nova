## Hey hey 🖖

I'm currently diving into the world of ✨web development✨, where I'm learning how to create engaging and responsive websites. 
With a focus on JS, HTML and CSS, I'm exploring different ways to make intuitive user interfaces and smooth experiences. 🧠


- 🤫 I'm currently working on something cool
- 🐈 My cat has her own Instagram page — and she's more popular than I am 🐱
- 🛠️ I’m strangely good at assembling IKEA furniture without using the instructions 
- 🍫 I’ve tried nearly every type of chocolate from around the world — Belgium still wins
